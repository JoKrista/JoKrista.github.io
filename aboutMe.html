    <p>I know I already have an About Me section in the homepage but lemme do this anyway. Mostly, because I need another page anyway.
        My name is Jo Krista Paula Aquino but I prefer to be called Jo more than anything else. I just like the simplicity of it. I have a cat
        that I love more than anything else in the world. I love to read and play games. Most of my money goes to these two hobbies.
        One of the reasons why I want to become a software developer is because it's a job that I can do that doesn't involve a lot of physical
        activities and of course, for the money. Granted, I still have to actually learn everything I can learn just to get to the starting line.
        And then find employment afterwards. Also, I like how codes look. I think they're beautiful. Which is why I dislike Wordpress &#128528.
        That's all.

        <p>P.S. All of this looks subpar not because I've been procrastinating. I blame my brother and his wedding. Honest!</p>
