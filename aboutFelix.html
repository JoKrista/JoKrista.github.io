        Simply put, Felix is the cutest. He loves to cuddle for hours! He's so very soft and mischievous. He has a fondness to yawn into anyone's
        face whenever he's cuddling with them. And let me tell you, his breath stinks! But, he is still the cutest.

    <h2>Here are some pictures of Felix!</h2>
    <h3>Sorry about the quality though, I never have been the best photographer ever.</h3>
